# ytcrawler
Web Crawler to pull different statistics from YouTube.

## Current Implementation
Currently the jupyter notebook prototype takes a given channel id and pulls the statistics of the channels the given channel is subscribed to.

E.g. Given your own channel id, the prototype pulls the statistics of all the channels you are subscribed to.

Currently only total views, subscriber count and number of videos is pulled. This is visualized in a blob diagram.
